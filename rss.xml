        <title>1. Hello World, and Vision for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
        <itunes:author></itunes:author>
        <itunes:subtitle>Anish and Brendon discuss the technologies behind autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence in general.</itunes:subtitle>
        <itunes:summary>Anish and Brendon open our first episode by talking about the technologies behind artificial intelligence: What is deep learning? How does it work? What key problems can it solve?

We continue to discuss a few specific applications of deep learning in autonomous driving, for both indoor and outdoor vehicles. Anish discusses semantic segmentation (a powerful technology for object recognition in images), and we wrap up the episode with Q/A.

        <title>5. Generative-Adversarial Neural Networks and Voiceprint Systems with Zach Trefler</title>
        <itunes:author></itunes:author>
        <itunes:subtitle>Brendon and Anish interview Zach Trefler about his research on designing neural networks to create adversarial examples to defeat a voiceprint identification system.</itunes:subtitle>
        <itunes:summary>Brendon and Anish interview Zach Trefler, a student at the University of Toronto, about his research on designing neural networks to create adversarial examples to defeat, and then improve the security of, a voiceprinting system.

We discuss how generative-adversarial networks are applied and how they can be applied to generate adversarial examples, in order to trick a security system into classifying the examples as a completely different user, and then how this can be used to develop a more secure system.
